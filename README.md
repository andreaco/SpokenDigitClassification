# Spoken Digit Classification

## Tasks:
- [ ] **Preprocessing**
- [ ] Feature selection
- [ ] Dataset split
- [ ] Feature extraction
- [ ] Feature selection
- [ ] Classification
- [ ] Performance evaluation  

## Description:
Implement a classifier able to predict which digit is pronounced in a short audio excerpt.
## Input:
As dataset use the Free Spoken Digit Dataset (FSDD) which is available at the link:
https://github.com/Jakobovski/free-spoken-digit-dataset
In the folder recodings you will find the audio files named in a specific format. Please read the READ ME distributed with the dataset.
The results of the classification must be reported as a confusion matrix and, optionally, other metrics of your choice.
## Output:
- a brief presentation of your work (max 5 minutes) that will be given to the class
- a more detailed report in which you illustrate and explain every step of your
classification system and in which the results are shown and commented (max 8
pages) to be delivered by May 17th.
- a link to a repository containing the code (e.g. on GitHub) with minimal comments.
